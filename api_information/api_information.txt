# File to show options for use in our api (Free options that have a lot of availability)

### Note: Could find default popular travel locations to suggest to people instead of searching for temperatures live ###

1. OpenWeatherMap

    Current weather
    Minute forecast for 1 hour
    Hourly forecast for 48 hours
    Daily forecast for 8 days
    National weather alerts
    Historical weather data for 40+ years back (since January 1, 1979)

    Pretty simple API calls for this api, and can search by specific latitudes and longitudes.

    Issue is going to be that you can't look up locations by keyword, so may have to use a csv to store many popular cities and their latitudes and longitudes.
    Also is going to be hard to find places that have similar temperatures.

2. Weatherbit API

    Issue: very limited; 50 API calls a day, but still has 7 days of future forecasts and current weather.

    Benefits: Able to get information based on an entered string for the city name.

3. WeatherAPI

    Issue: Costs $4 a month for the least amount of features
    Benefits: Many features; may be overkill
