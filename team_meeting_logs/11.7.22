Meeting notes
Home page:
Everything should be in cards or containers
Every piece of code should be modular and dynamic
Nothing should be hardcoded
Should loop through to be created on page loading
Use the information from the api and send to the page
Should fill the page with the information gotten from the api
Make it modular
Must discuss with database and front end people: Should be user friendly so it makes sense as to what to do next
Front end sells - needs to be appealing
