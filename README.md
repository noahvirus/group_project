# Application Name: WeatherMen
  This application will be a website focused on displaying the weather in different cities in the world. A user will also be able to register and log in to the website to save certain cities that will be allocated to their user information. It will also show the highest and lowest temperatures across the world. Also, a user will be able to see what clothes they should wear on the given day.

<br />
  The value of this application will be to personalize weather information intake. With this website, a user will quickly be able to see what the weather is for the day and be able to plan accordingly. Also, the user will be able to see what different cities are experiencing on a given day and get more background on foreign countries. We will offer travel suggestions to individuals for cities that have similar weather conditions to their favorite locations.
